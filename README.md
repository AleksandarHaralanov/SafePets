## Usage
By default, only OPs have permission.

Use PermissionsEx or similar plugins to grant groups the permission, enabling the commands.

### Permissions:
- `safepets.bypass` - Allows player to bypass the SafePets protection.

---
## Configurations
Generates `alive-pets.yml` and `dead-pets.yml` located at `plugins/SafePets/pets`.

Both configurations update dynamically as players interact with entities and rejoin the server.

### Alive Pets
Registers the unique IDs of pets that are currently aliveâ€”either tamed after the plugin was added or interacted with by their owner if they were tamed before the plugin was added.

### Dead Pets
Registers the unique IDs of pets that were killed while their owner was offline.

> [!WARNING]
> Wolf pets tamed before this plugin was added will not be automatically included in the configurations.
>
> They are only added to the `alive-pets.yml` config when their owner interacts with them by right-clicking.
>
> Until they are added, no one, including their owner, can harm the pets.
